# Http-Man
Very Simple C# CLI program that can make Http Requests (GET/POST)

Doesn't have many features (here is the list: get requests with headers, post requests wtih headers and json body), but it is enough to meet the needs i have.

Maybe i will update it in the future, but for now this is it.
